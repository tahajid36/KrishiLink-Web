# KrishiLink – Farmer’s Growth & Connection Platform

KrishiLink is a modern web application that connects farmers, traders, and consumers in one digital space. It functions as a social agro network where users can interact directly instead of a traditional buyer-seller model.

## Project Overview
**Why I made this project:**  
KrishiLink is a website where farmers can sell their crop directly to the customers in fair prices. Also the customers are benefited as they can get fresh crop/vegetables straight out of farm. Customers can show interest in crops and farmers can accept or reject. It'll connect farmers,traders,consumers in one place and bring them into a network.
